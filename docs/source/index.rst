###What is biceps_cmdln?
biceps_cmdln is a tool for calculating functional connectivity matrices.  
The tool is specifically designed for individuals who already have fMRI  
data that has been (1) denoised, (2) projected into a parcellated cifti space,  
(3) concatenated [in the case where multiple versions of a run type exist], (4)  
and the data is formatted using general BIDS Derivatives principles.

Using this pipeline is likely to be easiest if you are using tools generated  
by the DCAN group at the University of Minnesota to denoise your fMRI data.  

biceps_cmdln is specifically designed to calculate functional connectivity
matrices for a group of individuals.
